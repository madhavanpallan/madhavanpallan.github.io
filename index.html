               I am Madhavan Pallan, Currently a <b>Researcher in AI and Polyglot</b> with loyalties to IBM Research AI before that I gave strong 3 years in  <b>Business Analytics and Mathematical Sciences (BAMS) Group</b> at IBM Research, India. I am interested in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence Technologies in general and Deep learning, Social Network Analysis, Large Scale Data Mining, Statistics. I have worked on Problems like Submodularity, Automatic Augmenting, Data Extraction, Data Visualization, Neural Networks, Expected Maximization, Clustering, Classification, and semi-supervised learning on large-scale industrial datasets in bringing out insights.
            </p>
            <p class="main" style="color:white;font-weight:bold">
            Before joining IBM Research, I received my <b>Five Year Integrated Masters Degree (Hons.) in Mathematics and Computing</b>
            from Indian Institute of Technology located in BHU, (IIT (BHU)) Varanasi in 2013. My master thesis is a continuation of 
            work done for the Open Source Organization Scilab, INRIA Project as part of Google Summer of Code 2012, under the 
            mentorship of <b><i>Prof. Ricardo Fabbri</i></b> (Rio de Janeiro State University) and <b><i>Prof. Tanmoy Som</i></b> 
            (IIT(BHU)). I would also take a moment to thank my mentor <b><i>Dr Biplav Srivastava</i></b> and <b><i>Dr Dinesh Garg(till January 2014)</i></b>
            for guiding me through my journey at IBM Research, India. 
            I look forward to work on these technologies and am ready to learn new things to bring about development in the 
            aforementioned fields finally bringing big impact. My hobbies include developing electronic devices, building robots 
            solving daily tasks and reading Q/A on Quora.

                  We consider the team formation problem where the goal is to find a team of experts for a specific project. In the past, several attempts have been made to formulate this problem and each formulation focuses only on a subset of design criteria such as skill coverage, social compatibility, economy, skill redundancy, etc. In this paper, for the first time, we show that most of the important design criteria for this problem can be fully modeled within one single formulation as an <b>unconstrained submodular function maximization</b> problem. In our formulation, the submodular function turns out to be non-negative and non-monotone. The maximization of this class of submodular function is much less explored than its <b>monotone constrained</b> counterpart. A few recent works *\cite{GHARAN11}  *\cite{FEIGE11} have come up with a simulated annealing based randomized approximation scheme for this problem with an approximation ratio of <b>0.41</b>. In this paper, we customize this algorithm to our formulation and conduct an extensive set of experiments to show its efficacy. Our proposed formulation offers several advantageous features over the existing formulations including <b>skill cover softening</b>, <b>better team communication</b>, and <b>connectivity relaxation</b>.  Unlike previous formulations, the skill cover softening feature allows a designer to specify <b>Must Have</b> and <b>Should Have</b> skills. Similarly, through better team communication, we avoid the restriction that all the communication among team members should pass through only the team members and not the outsiders. Finally, connectivity relaxation feature alleviates the constraint of whole team being connected and thereby, lowering the cost.

                  We consider the team formation problem where the goal is to find a team of experts for a specific project. In the past, several attempts have been made to formulate this problem and each formulation focuses only on a subset of design criteria such as skill coverage, social compatibility, economy, skill redundancy, etc. In this paper, for the first time, we show that most of the important design criteria for this problem can be fully modeled within one single formulation as an <b>unconstrained submodular function maximization</b> problem. In our formulation, the submodular function turns out to be non-negative and non-monotone. The maximization of this class of submodular function is much less explored than its <b>monotone constrained</b> counterpart. A few recent works *\cite{GHARAN11}  *\cite{FEIGE11} have come up with a simulated annealing based randomized approximation scheme for this problem with an approximation ratio of <b>0.41</b>. In this paper, we customize this algorithm to our formulation and conduct an extensive set of experiments to show its efficacy. Our proposed formulation offers several advantageous features over the existing formulations including <b>skill cover softening</b>, <b>better team communication</b>, and <b>connectivity relaxation</b>.  Unlike previous formulations, the skill cover softening feature allows a designer to specify <b>Must Have</b> and <b>Should Have</b> skills. Similarly, through better team communication, we avoid the restriction that all the communication among team members should pass through only the team members and not the outsiders. Finally, connectivity relaxation feature alleviates the constraint of whole team being connected and thereby, lowering the cost.

This involved writing intermediate functions which form the fundamental background for working of both the different data-structures in scilab and leptonica. The library was made available to Scilab using siptoolbox. It also, involved making available two important leptonica functions in Scilab such as deskew and dewarp. The example functions were extensively tested on all types of images. </p>
